We present a comparative performance analysis of Parallel GPU based sorting algorithms. We implemented different versions of BrickSort and RadixSort, and compared them in different NVIDIA GPU architectures by using CUDA. Moreover, we describe optimization techniques used to make these algorithms more efficient in each newer version, including tools, libraries and methods.
