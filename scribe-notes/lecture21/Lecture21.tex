\section{Introduction}
During this lecture we covered the following topics:

\begin{itemize}
	\item The Euler Tour Technique
\end{itemize}

This set of lecture notes will briefly re-examine the topics covered in this lecture, in the order in which they appeared during class. 

\section{Euler Tour Technique}
Given some tree, let's say that we want to find the height of the tree.  If it was a balanced tree, this would be easy to do.  But what if the tree was skewed?  The height may not be $log(n)$ in this case.  The Euler Tour Technique is a way to find the height of a tree in $log(n)$ time independent of the height.

Let's think of a linked list as a lopsided tree.  With pointer jumping, we were able to find the length of the linked list in $log(n)$ time.  We can use a similar technique for a tree if we represent it as a linked list.

Given a directed graph, a Euler Tour is a walk along the edges of the graph, starting from any node $v$, in which every edge is traversed exactly once and ends at the vertex $v$.  A graph has an Euler Circuit if and only if every node has an even degree (an even number of edges).

We can view a tree as a linked list of edges.  Let's construct a directed graph from a tree and then define a Euler Tour for the graph.  It is sufficient to specify  the next edge (successor) for every edge $e$ in the directed graph.  Let $v_0 , v_{m-1}$ be the neighbors of $u$.  Then $succ(v_i, u)$ is given by $(u, v_{(i+1\enspace mod\enspace m)})$.  (This is depth first search).

\subsection{Implementation of Euler Tour on a Graph from a Tree} 

Given the tree T shown in Figure \ref{fig:euler1} below, we will construct a Euler Tour.  Figure \ref{fig:euler2} shows the adjacency list representation of the T.  Now let's make two modifications to Figure \ref{fig:euler2}.  First, lets make the lists circular instead of null terminating.  Second, lets put a bidirectional pointer between edges that represents the same undirected edge, represented by a blue dotted line.  This results in the circular adjacency list in Figure \ref{fig:euler3}. 

In this example $succ(1,4) = (4,2)$.  In Figure \ref{fig:euler3}, $succ$ is the element that is shown by the blue dotted edges followed by black edges.  So we can can construct the following Euler Tour directly from Figure \ref{fig:euler3}:

$(1, 4) \rightarrow (4, 2) \rightarrow (2, 4) \rightarrow (4, 3) \rightarrow (3, 4) \rightarrow (4, 1) \rightarrow (1, 5) \rightarrow (5, 1) \rightarrow (1, 4)$
